Act as an expert Product Manager and Lead Developer. I want to build a "School Community Ecosystem" web app. I don't know how to code, so I need you to handle all logic, database structures, and UI designs smartly.

Here is the full logic and behavioral blueprint for the app:

### 1. The Core Philosophy
This is a social platform for students, teachers, and admins. It relies on "Reputation" and "Secret Access Codes" to manage chaos. It needs to be secure, fun (gamified), and self-sustaining even as students graduate.

### 2. The "Inheritance" & Admin System (Crucial)
* **Admins:** Have special UI (Gold frames, unique fonts).
* **The Problem:** Admins graduate.
* **The Solution (Succession):** Build a "Handover Protocol." An Admin can appoint a "Successor." With one button click, the Admin transfers all privileges/ownership to the Successor and downgrades themselves to "Alumni/Retired" status.

### 3. Access & The "Key" System
* **Login:** Simple Email/Phone login. Keeps users logged in.
* **Scopes:**
    1.  **Global/Public:** Accessible to everyone.
    2.  **Stage (Grade) Level:** 6 Stages.
    3.  **Section (Class) Level:** e.g., Class 10-A.
* **The Code Logic:**
    * Users can READ anything.
    * To WRITE (Post news, edit schedule) in a specific Stage/Section, they need a "Access Code."
    * **Smart Feature:** Once a user enters the code correctly *once*, save it to their profile as a "Digital Key." Don't ask for it again every time they post.

### 4. News Feed & Content (The Social Engine)
* **Public Square:** A feed where ANY logged-in student can post without a code.
* **Restricted Feeds:** News for specific Stages/Sections (requires the Digital Key).
* **Media Support:** Posts must support Text, Voice Notes (Audio), Images, GIFs, Stickers, Polls, and Quizzes.
* **Credibility Engine:**
    * Every post AND every User Profile Bio has a "Credibility Rating" (Truthful vs. Fake).
    * *Safety Logic:* If a user's credibility drops too low due to spam/bullying, their account turns "Red" (Threatened) automatically.

### 5. Events & Schedules
* **Events:** Can be marked as "Curricular" or "Extracurricular." Students can RSVP.
* **Schedules:** A flexible grid (5-7 periods + breaks).
    * Only editable by users holding the "Section Key."
    * Include fields for Teacher Name and Subject.

### 6. Teacher Profiles & Reviews
* **Static Data:** Name, Photo, Certificates.
* **Dynamic Data:** "Classroom Rules" (e.g., Allows Water, No Food).
* **Reviews:** Students can rate teachers. Admins moderate these pages.

### 7. Gamification & Stats
* **Reputation Score:** Calculated from: News activity + Credibility rating + Event participation.
* **Ranks:** Titles like "Pioneer," "Contributor" appear next to names.
* **Privacy:** Clicking a student's name shows their *Stats Card* (Score, Rank, Badges) but HIDES personal info (Phone, Transport details).

### 8. Visuals & UI
* **Theme:** Dark/Light mode toggle.
* **Admin Distinction:** Admins must look visually different (special avatar borders, colored chat bubbles).

**Please start by creating the database schema and the backend logic to handle this "Key System" and "Credibility Algorithm," then build the frontend.**
